This is Event management System done by Subhakant Sahoo

I have used:
	xampp server for database
	python(flask) for backend
	html, css for frontend

I have attached all the necessary files to run the Project

First you have to install xampp 
Second start MySQL and Apache
Third import the sql file in the MySQL 
Fourth install flask in python
Finally run the app.py file

Good to go!!
